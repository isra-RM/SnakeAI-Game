# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of **Reinforcement Learning** to train an AI agent to play the classic Snake game. The implementation is inspired by Patrick Loeber's freeCodeCamp tutorial, [Python + PyTorch + Pygame Reinforcement Learning â€“ Train an AI to Play Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds&t=231s). 

# Installation
To set up the project, it is strongly recommended to create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv env_name
```
Once created, activate the virtual environment:

If using **command prompt**:
```command
env_name\Scripts\activate.bat
```
If using **PowerShell**:
```powershell
env_name\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After the environment is successfully set up and all  necessary dependencies are installed, execute the following command to start training the AI agent:
```powershell
python train.py
```
# Tools

For this game I used the following tools:

-**Pygame**.\
-**PyTorch**.\
-**Matplotlib**.\
-**NumPy**.\
-**Visual Studio Code**.\
